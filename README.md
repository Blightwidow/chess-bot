# Oxide chess bot

A very small and simple engine I am building to learn Rust.

## Acknowledgements

- An amazing thanks to @mvanthoor for his work on [Rustic](https://github.com/mvanthoor/rustic) that helped me understand a lot of concepts in Rust.
- Also a big part of my way of thinking was influenced by [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/). It was also a great tool to debug my code.

## Usage

You can directly form source

```
cargo run -r -- <command>
```

or build and then run the executable

```
cargo build -r
./taget/release/chessbot <command>
```
